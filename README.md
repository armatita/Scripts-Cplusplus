# Scripts-Cplusplus
General scripts I've made with C++ language associated with my R&amp;D in CERENA. It would be hard to separate them into a specific projects so I'm just building a general purpose repository to ensure no information is lost. The scientific fields of the scripts are mostly data management, manipulation in geosciences.
